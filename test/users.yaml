# The format of this file is: ${username: String} -> ${user_data: UserData}"
#
# Currently there is only a single field on the UserData object: "hashed_password". The value of "hashed_password" is
# a bcrypt hashed base64 encoded sha256 of a users raw password. This is done to allow passwords of length greater than
# 72 characters which is a limitation of the bcrypt algorithm.
#
# Programmatically:
#
#   password = "IAmTheWalrus"
#   prepared_password = b64encode(sha256(password.encode("UTF-8")).digest())
#   hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(prepared_password, bcrypt.gensalt())
